# snapjax
a fast, flexible SuperNova Analysis Pipeline for Cosmology in Jax

Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) are standard candles used to infer the expansion rate of the universe by measuring distances to large redshifts. We can write down a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) which incorporates cosmology and SNIa properties to estimate cosmological parameters from a set of observed SNIa. 

If we code the cosmological calculations *differentiably*, we can perform HMC sampling efficienty in `Jax` and `Numpyro`, and make the code easy to read and modular to boot. This is what `snapjax` is all about.
